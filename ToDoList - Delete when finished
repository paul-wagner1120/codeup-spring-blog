Create a User class, with (at least) fields for id, username, email, and password.

In your User and Post classes, define the post - user relationship.

Log in to the MySQL server and verify that the generated table structure matches what you are expecting.

Manually insert a user record in the database.

Create a UserRepository interface and inject it into the PostController.

When a post is created, and before it is saved to the database, assign a user to it. For now, it does not matter which user is assigned, so long as some user is assigned. In the next lesson we will make this functionality more robust.

On the show page for an individual post, display the email of the user that created the post.
